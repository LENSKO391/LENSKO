### 📖 About Me

I am a back-end developer-in-training through the rigorous **ALX Software Engineering Program**.  
I believe that just as salvation is **by grace through faith**, so is learning and mastery in software development — a gift, not a boast!  

> _"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men."_ – Colossians 3:23  

My passion for software engineering is grounded in the joy of **solving real-world problems**, the elegance of **system design**, and the satisfaction of **order out of chaos** — an echo of the Creator's design.

💡 **My Vision:**  
To glorify God through excellent work in technology, building scalable, secure systems that serve people and reflect order, logic, and clarity.

🚀 **What I Love Working On:**  
- 🛠 Clean, Testable Code  
- 🧠 System Design & Architecture  
- 📦 Building RESTful APIs  
- 🔐 Security-first Applications  
- 🧰 Contributing to OSS with a missional heart
